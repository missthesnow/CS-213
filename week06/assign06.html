    <p style="clear: right; text-align: justify;">Themis University is a private university located on the island of Crete. 
        Founded in 20XX as an institution dedicated to Justice in the <a href="art.html">Arts</a>, 
        <a href="athletics.html">Athletics</a> and overall <a href="academics.html">Academics</a>, it is the oldest
        mythical university on the island. Sponsored by locals in an effort to unite the intellectual and physiological
        parties on the island, the university was named after the Titaness, Themis, the goddess of Divine Law. Originally, the 
        institution was merely a gathering place for those wishing to reconcile preferred activities, but it soon blossomed
        into a conservatory for the athletic and artistic alike. The university sponsors additional fields of academic study
        as they are desired by the student body. 
        <br>Themis University is organized into two constituent schools: the College of Athletics, and the College of Art. 
        While both schools are managed under the university's Academic Order, each school's faculty oversees its respective 
        curriculum and degree programs. In addition to a central campus in Heraklion, the university owns athletic facilities 
        in Sitia and Ierapetra. 
        <br>Regardless of college affiliation, all students have unbridled access to the Themis University Library, which 
        serves all constituent schools, and holds more than 15 million volumes spanning numerous academic disciplines.
        <br>Themis University undergraduates follow a liberal arts curriculum. Almost all members of the Faculty of Arts and Athletics teach 
        undergraduate courses, more than 2,000 of which are offered annually. Students compete intercollegiately as the 
        Themis Myrmidons.</p>

      <p style="clear: right; text-align: left;">Themis is an ancient Greek Titaness. She is described as "[the Lady] of 
        good counsel", and is the personification of divine order, fairness, law, natural law, and custom. Her symbols 
        are the Scales of Justice, tools used to remain balanced and pragmatic. Themis, quite simply, means "divine law." 
        To the ancient Greeks she was originally the organizer of the "communal affairs of humans." Moses Finley remarked 
        of Themis:</p>
        <blockquote style="font:Verdana; font-size:2em; color: #FFFFFF">
            "Themis is untranslatable. A gift of the gods and a mark of civilized existence, sometimes it means right 
                custom, proper procedure, social order, and sometimes merely the will of the gods (as revealed by an omen, 
                for example) with little of the idea of right."
          </blockquote>

            <em>At Themis University, we strive to be a mark of civilized existence as we unite the Divine Laws 
            governing the Arts, Athletics and all Academics.</em></p>
