      <i>"I was given something wonderful, something that changed me forever... A vision of the universe that 
          tells us, undeniably, how tiny, and insignificant and how ... rare, and precious we all are! A vision 
          that tells us that we belong to something that is greater than ourselves, that we are not — that none 
          of us — are alone! ... I wish I could share that. I wish, that everyone, if even for one moment, 
          could feel that awe, and humility, and hope!"</i>

        <h2 style="text-align: left;">Excerpt from <b>Five Fifths of the World</b></h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">We sat in silence for quite a while. The sun is hot, but I do not mind. 
            It makes Damick's hair a pretty almond. I remember Andaraa saying she liked this about him, it is 
            about the only thing I agree with her on. Though it is selfish of me to look on his appearance when he 
            is grieving so. But I cannot help it. <i>He is impossible to ignore just as it is now impossible to ignore 
            the scent of blossoms in the spring,</i></p>
        	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It is coming,” He says.
            <br><i>Or to ignore the silver of a full moon on a clear night,</i>
        	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What, rain?” I ask.
            <br><i>Or to ignore the sound of water rushing down a fall, or, or --</i>
        	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes.” He replies.
            <br><i>Or to ignore the feel of the coming of rain.</i>
        	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“How do you know?”
            <br><i>He is all of these, scent, sight, sound, feel...</i>
        	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I know it in my bones. I have rain in my bones you know.”
            <br><i>All except taste. But I know it will remain so.</i>
        	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“That sounds very cold.”
            <br><i>And that is fine, I have sensed four fifths of the world through him.</i>
        	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It is.”
            <br><i>Even without taste or drink, I have thrived in those four fifths.</i>
        	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Are your bones made of rain or is the outside bone and the inside filled of rain?”
            <br><i>He has given me more than I could have found on my own.</i>
        	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The latter, I think. Although I have not checked.”
        	<p>I had thought he might be making a joke about the rain in his bones, but his face remained expressionless. 
                Perhaps he meant it was the sadness within him that could sense the coming rain. A single tear rolled down 
                his face and at the same moment a small raindrop hit the dirt. I could hear the small <i>pit</i> that echoed 
                upon its contact. I had begun to reach for his hand but something stopped me. He was not mine to love.</p>
       <p style="text-align: justify;">At that moment, I felt my physical senses leave me. 
            Not in the same way that the fairy had taken them, instantly and cruelly. No, this was <i>fading</i> 
            and <i>dizzying</i>, like I had the chance to reach out and pull them back if I tried. He was not mine 
            to love; I would lose my senses forever.</p>
       <p style="text-align: justify;">The smell of the grass and rain fades and with it, 
          the emeralds and cobalts and other nuances of color I had perhaps begun to take for granted. The sound 
          of the pounding rain resigns to my imagination and so does the feel of Damick's hand. I see his mouth 
          move and expect to hear nothing, but I am granted his last words to me.</p>
