      <i>"I was given something wonderful, something that changed me forever... A vision of the universe that 
          tells us, undeniably, how tiny, and insignificant and how ... rare, and precious we all are! A vision 
          that tells us that we belong to something that is greater than ourselves, that we are not — that none 
          of us — are alone! ... I wish I could share that. I wish, that everyone, if even for one moment, 
          could feel that awe, and humility, and hope!"</i>

      <h2>Excerpt from <b>Five Fifths of the World</b></h2>
      <p style="padding-right: 50em; text-align: justify;"">At that moment, I felt my physical senses leave me. Not in the same way that the 
          fairy had taken them, instantly and cruelly. No, this was <i>fading</i> and <i>dizzying</i>, like 
          I had the chance to reach out and pull them back if I tried. He was not mine to love; 
          I would lose my senses forever.</p>
      <p style="padding-right: 50em; text-align: justify;">The smell of the grass and rain fades and with it, the emeralds and cobalts and other 
          nuances of color I had perhaps begun to take for granted. The sound of the pounding rain 
          resigns to my imagination and so does the feel of Damick's hand. I see his mouth move and 
          expect to hear nothing, but I am granted his last words to me.</p>
